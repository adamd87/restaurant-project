## General info
This project is my original idea to create a place where I can improve my skills. At the beginning I started to build a backend environment using Spring Boot, where I created a simple security system that allows logging in form a group of predetermined users.
Then I started to create a structure with Menu, Order and Product entities, created repositories and rest controllers, witch gives me the basis to start working on the frontend with what I have created so far.
My frontend site is based on Angular.
